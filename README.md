# Asteroid Space Shooter

Presented on the bottom of the screen, there will be a space ship gliding left and right following the x-axis of the mouse while infintely moving forward. The ship will be traveling across an astreroid field! Using the mouse click to destroy any oncoming obstacles, as the levels progress the health of the obstacles will be more. The game will end when the ship is destroied.

### Guide through my thinking:
- _**Landing page:**_ First the player will be presented by a title page with 2 options of game play: Normal or Hard.

- _**Initialization:**_ The ship will be following the mouses' x-axis coordinate along bottom of screen. The background will have the illusion of warp speed traveling.
 
- _**Game play:**_ Having to 'shoot' with the mouse to destory the rocks in the path of your ship. If the rocks touch the ship, it's health will decrease. As the player progresses through the levels, the game will get more dificult.

- _**Win condition:**_ The goal would be how far can the player get before completly destroying their ship (What it the highest level you can reach?).
 
- _**Reset:**_ When the ship gets destroied, it will blow up and form the message GAME OVER from the "cloud". Will then load back up to the title screen.
