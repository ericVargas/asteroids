# Asteroids in Space!

Your ship will be traveling across an astreroid field!
Using the mouse click to destroy any oncoming obstacles. As the levels progress, more asteroids will appear! 
Clear the path before the time runs out!

### Guide through my thinking:
- _**Landing page:**_ First the player will be presented by a title page with a How To and Start buttons.

- _**Initialization:**_ The player will then be brought to a different screen where asteroids will appear randomly. The background will have the illusion of warp speed traveling.
 
- _**Game play:**_ Having to destory the rocks in the screen with your mouse. There will be a timer for how long the rocks will need to be cleared. As the player progresses through the levels, the game will get more dificult as more asteroids appear.

- _**Win condition:**_  If any rocks are still on the screen when the timer runs out, the game is over. The goal is to see what is the highest level you can reach.
 
- _**Reset:**_ When you don't complete a level, the screen will "blow up" and form the message GAME OVER from its "cloud". The screen will then transition over to a Play Again screen, which will display the highest level reached and a play again button.
